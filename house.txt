My house devise is my microwave oven, which is not as complex or versitile as a modern computer, but does take instructions from a "programmer" in this case a user who gives instructions to it. Its shape is just like a wooden box with sufficient space to fit a grown up house cat inside, It has a metal cooking chamber inside with a door, it has a rotating component inside to distribute microwaves evenly thoughout the food. Modern computers like our laptops take inputs and process them to provide an output result, in the same way my microwave takes input variables such as temperature, time and selection of different settings depending upon the kind of food which is being cooked at a given time. In microwaves control panels acts like input instructions which gives instructions to the embedded system, modern microwave ovens use either an analog dial-type timer or a digital control panel for operation. Just like a motherboard it also has a circuit board which allows the electrical components to communicate with each other. It has a microprocessor chip which basically acts like a computer devise, controls the heating and timing functions or variables of the microwave while taking input from the control panel and various sensors. It does not have an operating system but have an embedded system which performs a very specific function, these systems contain a single program that executes all the functions required unlike the operating systems of modern computers which deals with more complex and versatile functions. 

*Working of the system:
The embedded system of a microwave oven works as a computer device. It takes input from the keypad and turn them into commands. For example if a programmer or one who is giving instructions to a microwave oven gives an instruction to it to operate on high for four minutes, the embedded system triggers the high voltage transformer to operate on full for four minutes. When the four minutes expire, the embedded system commands the transformer to turn off. Because the embedded system does nothing more than translate simple commands, it contains relatively simple programming.

*conclusion:
Microwave ovens do show some basic characteristics of a modern Von Nuemann Architecture of a computer, but does it in a very limited fashion. It does all the processing and computation that a modern computer does, but it lacks in versatility, and computational possibilities. But as Turing said "Does because something thinks differently from others does that mean its not thinking".
